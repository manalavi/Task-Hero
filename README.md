# Client-Based To-Do List Application

> Organize your life, one task at a time, even offline!

## Problem statement


Many to-do list applications require an internet connection and often involve complex setups or logins. This can be cumbersome for a simple and quick task management solution that individuals want to use offline.

## Proposed solution


A client-side to-do list application built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that operates entirely offline. This application leverages the browser's local storage to store tasks, ensuring that the data persists even when the browser or device is closed and reopened.

## Tech stack


 - "HTML"
 - "CSS"
 - "JavaScript"

## Features

### Add New Task


Users can add new tasks to their list. Each task will be stored locally within the user's browser using the browser's local storage.  This ensures that even when the browser is closed and reopened, the task list persists.

### Mark as Complete


Each task in the list will have a checkbox. Users can click the checkbox to mark a task as complete. The application will visually distinguish completed tasks from pending ones, for example, by striking through or dimming completed tasks.

### Delete Tasks


Users are provided with an option to delete tasks from their list. They can choose to delete a single task or clear the entire list. 

### Theme Customization


The application offers different themes or color palettes to choose from, allowing users to customize the appearance to their liking.
